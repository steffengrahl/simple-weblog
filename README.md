# Simple Weblog I

A show-and-tell project to show my students how to create a simple but extendable and maintainable web application in php. I use a very old coding style without objects or frameworks to adapt to what my students already know and use. In another project I will show them how to create a simple router, use objects and store data in a database instead of a json file.
